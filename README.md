Iris Flower Classifier
This Python script trains multiple machine learning models to classify the Iris flower dataset, evaluates them, and visualizes a confusion matrix for the best model.

Models Trained
The following models are trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
SVM
Additional polynomial features are created to provide more signal to the models.

Usage
The script requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

numpy 
scikit-learn
matplotlib


python iris_classifier.py

Typical Output ..

DecisionTreeClassifier: 0.953
RandomForestClassifier: 0.967 
SVC: 0.953
Test Accuracy: 0.956

The random forest model performed best with ~97% accuracy.

The confusion matrix summarizes the prediction accuracy and errors for each class.

Next Steps
Some ways to improve the model:

Tuning hyperparameters for the random forest to improve accuracy
Using PCA to reduce number of polynomial features
Handling class imbalance in the data
Comparing additional models like MLP, Naive Bayes, etc.

The Iris classifier code refers to the Python script we developed to train machine learning models to categorize Iris flowers into one of three Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurement data.

More specifically:

- The Iris classifier code loads the Iris flower dataset which includes 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for 150 flowers from 3 Iris species

- It splits the data into train and test sets

- It trains three models on the data (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) using cross-validation to evaluate them

- It fits the best model (Random Forest) on the full training data 

- Then tests it on the held out test data to assess generalization performance

- Finally, it generates a confusion matrix visualization to provide insight into the types of prediction errors


So in summary, the Iris classifier code:

1. Loads the Iris data
2. Trains models 
3. Evaluates via cross-validation
4. Fits the best model
5. Assesses test accuracy 
6. Generates a confusion matrix plot

It provides a complete example machine learning workflow for training, evaluating and diagnosing classification models on the Iris dataset.
